# Play Test Ready Checklist #
* Map replicates the actual gameboard (i.e. has all the same routes and cities)
* Endgame points are calculated and winners are reported
    * need to check all sources of endgame points
* Stendal to Arnheim (The east-west route)
    * Will need a component to communicate winners 
    * Will need a route traversal method when either of these cities are taken
* Coellen special city points
    * Maybe make it collapsible if I'm running out of space? 
    * Need an option when clicking on the city
* Need a settings drop down (Change clicks default) - maybe differentiate between "player" and "client" - client has access to settings, player is a game state concept
* Need the ability to save and resume
* Need to remove the starting 8 tokens from player supply
* Need to add installation instructions to the read me

# TODOs #
* 5/16
    * test with http://localhost:3000/onlineGame/testRoom1?participantId=iigJEToZqLT8NCpUukFgfz & http://localhost:3000/onlineGame/testRoom1?participantId=uW2d8XHHZn6SPb3vTak3uW
    * clean up my todos a bit
    * Create some logic so that when sockets don't actually exist (only for testing) we don't fail, but instead warn that we should only be seeing this while testing
-------------------
    
# Test basic online gameplay # 
1. Have the links for both participants for testing sake (from the prebuilt room)
2. **HERE** need to send the action information to all other players in the session. (use the exclude parameter and consider how to get the participant ID)
3. Then need to add methods to the clientWebSocketControllerFactory.js to handle actions being taken by other players, i think this will be my next big project


* Need to look at everywhere where I have a conditional involving isHotseatMode. Many just don't do anything if isHotseatMode is false

**IMPORTANT** it looks like playerId is undefined in many gameController methods - placeWorkerOnNodeAction for example
// Would be nice to add "you" to the player's name in the turn tracker
// isHotseatMode should also have an isOnlineMode (these are just opposites of each other. maybe this is unnecessary)


* Online play:
        * Should break this into a few different areas: ~~landing page~~, waiting room, routing, signalling, file structure, and game logic (pretty sure game logic will be the hardest)
        * Waiting Room:
            * Thoughts for tackling breaking into the main game logic:
                * let's try to break logic for both hotseat and online into the main tab?
                * I guess in the worst case I can create a method to generate the entire HTML body? and then both can call that function
                * how are we going to handle online saving?
                * will need a new mainLogic method for dealing with WS communication
            * add chat
            * clean up css and general beautification - maybe should see if I can read anything online for making prettier web pages?
        * Server related to waiting room:
            * need to account for un-readying and leaving the room - we will tie them to the same method I think (although there's a difference between freeing up waiting room space and a player becoming un-ready)
        * Building the server
            * Read up on express best practices and the MDN HTTP docs
            * I will also need to add the data base. NoSQL might be easier? Regardless, that can probably come later
        * Will need a different route from hotseat
        * will need it's own main.js
        * can we use the same main.html?
        * I think we still initialize everything the same way?
------
* waiting room chat
* maybe allow you to start an online game by simply joining a room?
* add the ability to cancel the online ready-up 
* there's a lot of copy paste between the websocket controllers. Maybe I should add some helpers? While I'm at it, maybe give the websocket logic its own folder
* really need to get better at using the node debugger, maybe try to watch something on it when I'm home
* consider adding a room class to the server (might not make sense when we switch to a real Database)
* refactor the "newRoom" POST route to not use errors (or at least not unless the value fails sanitation)
# Main Game TODOs #
* endgame points calculation
* add currentTurn to the turn tracker or the game history or both (as in how many turns have elapsed total)
* Keyboard shortcuts - will need to track state if you can actually make changes (like to the inputHandler action type), otherwise it's a no-op
* At some point would like to make the tokens into a more readable form - will need a map and use what ever the rule book calls them on page 8
* maybe add a nice 'hover' effect to the pieces? like a shadow or border. The color picker came out well
* Stuff will eventually end up being async. I might need some sort of de-bouncer? Or is that not the correct word?
* TODO! all methods will need to actually pass in the playerId. Probably give inputHandlers a playerId field
* will need to replace the gameController reference in the inputHandlers with an API (which either uses signalling or just straight references it via the logic bundle)
* eventually will need a 'settings' property for things like AUTO_SCROLL and USE_DEFAULT
* consider using dynamic import https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import vs https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import so that I can make main.js *NOT* a module
* consider adding a shadow effect to the pieces
* add installation and run instructions to README
* Host my own sever - need to look up IONOS docs
* consider renaming "inputHandlers" to something more accurate
* add an easy method to clear the board information fields (check where this is already happening)
* I **HATE** how hacky my token coordinate system is - need to use system where we invert the slope and calculate the offset from that instead. Remember that the distance should always be the same, just to write out a simple system of coordinate equations when I get the chance
* add all the game logs to bump - just update a list on bumpInformation
* add a settings button - for the moment really just for the sake of having a drop down, but maybe also add the ability to toggle default mode - also perhaps a collapsible rules doc? token explanation at the very least
* add a cancelSelection button to action bar (only works if you haven't done part of an action like move)
* make nodes hoverable text with their ids as text - tooltip?
* place collapse buttons at the actual edges. Might do some calculations when creating them
* ^^^ need to actually use createDivWithClassAndIdAndStyle in place of document.createElement
* technically, it's legal to swap circles and squares as part of a move action (for two moves)
* make sure that the gameboard is scrollable -- This seems surprisingly hard. It might just make sense to remove the property from the gameboard for the moment
* organize css into sections under comments
* when reorganizing css, use nesting
* replace a lot of the css copy pasta, stuff like centered with flex into utility classes
* refactor the warn and clear - should probably rename it to make it clear it's unrelated to player info
* add chat to game log (only relevant in online play)
* Move some of the gameController copy pasta into it's own methods
* Add a turn timer to the turn tracker
* keyboard short cuts for place and selecting shape
* localStorage (this is for saving game state), sessionStorage is for single tabs
* create a readable form of route id for logging, i.e. "the route between Hamburg and Berlin"
* check all TODOs
* For landing page - have a list of valid colors (no text on white background nonsense)
* Fix the collapsible button and container code to involve less copy-pasta
* write out a game flow document
* maybe rename 'board' --> 'map' in the case of the main game board? I keep confusing it with player board
* ESLINT semi colon - ugh prettier was a hassle, might come back to this

# Stretch Goals (in no particular order) # #
* NOTE: when the favicon is requested a 404s, chrome doesn't request it again on subsequent refreshes, need to use cmd+shift+r for hard refresh
* convert some of my objects to JS maps
* read https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/Overview MDN guide to brush back up on http knowledge
* when doing online play we will likely need some sort of player validator. We don't want to update actionInfoDiv.innerText for example when its not the player's turn.
~~local storage~~
* potentially add an overarching UI controller which is in charge of gameboard, playerBoard, turnTracker, pointTracker, gameLog, ---- this would mainly be in charge of things like ending turns and initializing and resuming
* add an end game calculator
* eventually, using 'this' is going to be preferable to referencing the gameController object as there may be more than one - will need a lot of clean up
* resume game,
* landing page 
* keyboard short cuts
* mouse over text for player fields
* refactor some methods to be separate helper functions 
* convert to TS
* add a very stupid single plyer mode 
* maybe move things like routes and cities to their own classes
* refactor to only pass player unless absolutely necessary - using playerId is a pain in the ass and problematic
* undo action button 
* track game logic server side (only for online non-hotseat modes)
* unit tests for all internal methods
~~add a favicon~~
~~add linter~~
* reorganize CSS and methods (just the ordering)
* add images for tokens and parts of the player board (i.e. keys and the book in liber sophia and purses)
* corner case of empty bank and supply when being bumped - technically the player can move their placed pieces
* use a bundler like web pack or vite
* read through mdn's web dev docs for a more generalized refresher https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Web_standards
* converting things like game controller and board controller to classes may make it easier to have multiple games running as we don't want them to be singletons - I think that's a bit in the future though, it's only relevant if the game logic is running server side, as long as it all occurs in the client we don't need to worry
* add a github link - I'm sure I can find a nice one somewhere online
* make it so form validation happens real time (as opposed to on submission)
* I am inconsistent in using 'Id' vs 'ID' in variable names

// npx nodemon app.js (now I don't have to restart it all the time!)
// collapse all = cmd-k and then cmd-0
// unfold all - cmd-k and then cmd-j
// jump to line number - can click on the goto at the bottom of the page (i.e. "Ln 127, Col 87")
